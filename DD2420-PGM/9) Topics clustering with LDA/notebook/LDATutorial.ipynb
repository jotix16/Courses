    "\n",
    "### Background and terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we will be working in the setting of text corpora, we should clarify some of the terminology used in this setting:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>A word is the basic unit of discrete data, defined to be an item from a vocabulary indexed by {1, . . . ,V}. \n",
    "<li> A document is a sequence of <i>N</i> words denoted by <b>w</b>=(<i>w</i><sub>1</sub>,<i>w</i><sub>2</sub>, . . . ,<i>w</i><sub>N</sub>), where <i>w</i><sub>n</sub> is the <i>n</i>th word in the sequence.</li>\n",
    "<li>A corpus is a collection of <i>M</i> documents denoted by $D$ ={<b>w</b><sub>1</sub>,<b>w</b><sub>2</sub>, . . . ,<b>w</b><sub>M</sub>}</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that LDA works in other domains besides text collections, but this is the setting in which we will use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "LDA is a generative probabilistic model that is used for modeling collections of discrete data. In our application we will be using it to model text corpora, or more specifically news group e-mails. The purpose of the model is to give us compact representations of the data in these collections, allowing us to process large collections while still retaining sufficient information to be able to perform for example classification and relevance measures. \n",
    "\n",
    "There have been several solutions for this type of information retrieval problem, such as the tf-idf (term frequency - inverse document frequency) scheme by Salton and McGill, 1983. This approach produces a term-by-document matrix X whose columns contain the tf-idf values for each of the documents in the corpus. This representation however did not provide significantly shortened representation of the corpora, or represent the inter- or intra- document statistics in a intuitive way. A step forward from this was given by LSI (latent semantic indexing) where singular value decomposition was used on the matrix X to offer a more compact representation. The authors of the method also argued that since the LSI features are linnear combinations of the basic tf-idf features, they incorporate some linguistical notions such as synonomy and polysemy.\n",
    "The first step to providing a generative model was the <i>probabilistic</i> LSI (pLSI), which uses mixture models to model each word in a document. The mixture components are the \"topics\" and represented as multinomial random variables, allowing different words in the document to be genereated by different topics. The compact representation for each document is then the list of numbers representing the mixing proportions for the fixed set of topics. The method however gives no generative probabilistic model for getting these numbers, causing the number of parameters in the model to grow linearly with the corpus size. Also, since there is no probabilistic model for the mixture components that represent a document, there is no clear way of assigning a probability to a document that is outside the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both LSI and pLSI use the \"bag-of-words\" approach which assumes exchangeability within the words of the document as well as the documents themselves, meaning their order is of no importance. A theorem due to de Finetti (1990) states that any collection of exchangeable random variables has a representation as a mixture distribution—in general an infinite mixture. This means we must consider mixture models that capture the exchangeability of both documents and words if we wish to achieve exchangeable representations for them. It is this line of thinking that leads to LDA.\n",

    "### Theory Behind LDA\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, LDA is a generative probabilistic model for a corpus. It can be seen as a hierarchical Bayesian model with three levels: each document in a corpus is modeled as a finite random mixture over a latent set of topics, and each of these topics are characterized by a distribution of words. A graphical model for LDA using plate notation can be seen below:\n",
    "![title](imgs/LDAPlateGM.png)\n",
    "From here we can see the three levels of the model. $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ and corpus level parameters, $\\theta$ is a document level parameter for the M documents in the corpus, and $z$ and $w$ are word level parameters for the N words in a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "The generative process according to LDA for each document <b>w</b> is then:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>Choose N ∼Poisson(ξ)</li>\n",
    "<li>Choose $\\theta$∼Dir($\\alpha$)</li>\n",
    "<li>For each of the N words w<sub>n</sub>:\n",
    "<ol type=\"a\">\n",
    "    <li>Choose a topic z<sub>n</sub> ∼Multinomial($\\theta$).</li>\n",
    "    <li>Choose a word w<sub>n</sub> from p(w<sub>n</sub> |z<sub>n</sub>,$\\beta$), a multinomial probability conditioned on the topic z<sub>n</sub>.</li>\n",
    "    </ol></li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are however some simplifications to these steps that we will utilize. First, we assume that the dimensionality of the Dirichlet distribution, and therefore the dimensionality for the topic variable $z$ is known and fixed, meaning we assume a fixed known number of topics, $k$. Furthermore, the probabilities for words ($w$) are parameterized by a $k \\times V$ matrix $\\beta$ which defines $p(w^j = 1| z^i = 1) = \\beta_{i,j}$, that we will estimate later and keep fixed. We also note that $N$ is independant of the other data generating variables $\\theta$ and <b>z</b> so we will ignore the Poisson assumption and set it to a known fixed value (the length of the document).  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dirichlet Distribution in LDA\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability distribution for a $k$-dimensional Dirichlet random variable $\\theta$ is defined as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Eq. 1:</b>\n",
    "![Eq 1](imgs/LDAEq1.png \"Eq 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\alpha$ is $k$-dimensional with all elements larger than 0 and $\\Gamma(x)$ is the Gamma function. The Dirichlet distribution has some advantegous advantageous qualities; it is in the exponential family, has finite dimensional sufficient statistics, and is conjugate to the multinomial distribution. These properties help us in running variational inference for the parameters later.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now express the joint distribution of a topic mixture $\\theta$, a set of $N$ topics <b>z</b>, and\n",
    "a set of $N$ words <b>w</b> given the corpus level parameters $\\alpha,\\beta$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Eq. 2:</b>\n",
    "![Eq. 2](imgs/LDAEq2.png)\n",
    "where the probability $p(z_n |\\theta)$ is simply $\\theta_i$ for the unique $i$ such that $z^i_n=1$. We can then obtain the marginal distribution over a document by integrating over $\\theta$ and summing over $z$:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Eq. 3:</b>\n",
    "![Eq. 3](imgs/LDAEq3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Comparison to other Latent Variable Models\n",
    "In order to get feeling for how LDA works and what highlights its strengths, it can be helpful to relate it to other related models:\n",
    "\n",
    "  a) Unigram Model\n",
    "\n",
    "  b) Mixture of Unigrams Model\n",
    "\n",
    "  c) pLSI Model\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin by examing the absolute simplest model, the unigram model: \n",
    "\n",
    "![Eq. 3](imgs/UniGramMdl.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This method has no latent variables and instead states that each word in a document is independantly drawn from a single multinomial distribution as seen here:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Eq. 3](imgs/UniGramEq.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A slighly more complex model is the mixture of unigrams:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Eq. 3](imgs/MixUniGramMdl.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This model incorporates a discrete latent topic variable, $z$. Here, each document <b>w</b> is generated by first sampling the topic variable $z$, and then generating all words from a conditional probability on that choice:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Eq. 3](imgs/MixUniGramEq.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This effectively limits the modeling of words in a document to only being representative of one topic. The LDA model on the other hand allows for documents to exhibit multiple topics with different mixtures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we have the pLSI model which we mentioned earlier. It was a relatively popular model around the time that LDA was proposed, and is the model with highest generative capabilities of these three mentioned. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Eq. 3](imgs/PISLMdl.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "pLSI proposes that each word is conditionally independant a \"document label\", $d$, given an unobserved topic $z$:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Eq. 3](imgs/PISLEq.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This proposal aims to soften the constraint of having each document modeled as being generated from only one topic, as it is in the mixture of unigrams approach. It does so by incorporating the probability, $p(z | d)$ for a certain document $d$ as the mixture of topics that document. A true generative model cannot be created for this mixture however; as d is only a dummy index to the documents pISL was trained with, meaning it is a multinomial random variable with the same amount of possible values as training documents. This leads to the method only learning the topic mixtures, $p(z | d)$, for documents it has already seen, so there is no natural way to assign probability to an unseen document with it.\n",
    "Another problem is that to model $k$ topics with pLSI you need K multinomial distributions with vocabulary size $V$ and $M$ mixtures over the hidden topics $k$ for each training document, resulting in $kV + kM$ parameters. Not only does this not scale well but it is also prone to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "LDA however treats the topic mixture weights as a $k$-parameter hidden variable, meaning the amount of parameters does not scale linnearly with the number training documents, and the generative model can still be used even with unseen documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see these differences geometrically as well if we examine the distribution over words as a $V$-1 dimensional on a vocabulary of size $V$ with another $k$-1 dimensional simplex spanning $k$ topics. We can set $V$ and $k$ to 3 for simplicity (3 words gives a two-dimensional triangle):\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](imgs/UnigramSampling.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "How this distribution is spread out and how it uses the topics distribution differs among the methods. The mixture of unigrams method pics a random point on the word simplex that corresponds to one of the topic simplex vertices k, and draws all the words for a document from the distribution corresponding to that point. pLSI assumes that all words in training documents belong to a single randomly chosen topic. The topics are drawn from a document-specific distribution, meaning each document has a topic distribution that sits on the topic simplex. The training documents then give an empirical distribution (with the marked 'x's) over the topic simplex. LDA instead models that <b>each word</b> in a document is drawn from a randomly chosen topic that is sampled from a distribution governed by a random parameter. Since this parameter is sampled once per document, it gives a smooth probability distribution over the topic simplex (the circular topology markers). \n",

    "The main inference problem we will be interested in solving is the posterior distribution of the latent variables given a document, which would allow us to infer the topics associated with the document. This is given by the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "p( \\theta, \\mathbf{z} \\mid \\mathbf{w}, \\alpha, \\beta) = \\frac{p( \\theta, \\mathbf{z}, \\mathbf{w} \\mid \\alpha, \\beta)}{p(\\mathbf{w} \\mid \\alpha, \\beta)} \n",

    "\n",
    "#### Variational Inference for LDA\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to use several VI methods for LDA, including La Place approximation, variational approximation, and MCMC methods. In our case, we will be using the convexity-based variational approximation that was mentioned in  Olga's tutorial. From there we learned that in this VI we attempt to reformulate/simplify the original graphical model by removing some dependencies and introducing free variational parameters. This leads to a family of distributions dependant on these variational parameters which form a lower bound on the log likelyhood. We then aim to find the parameter values that give the tightest lower bound. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, the problematic dependancy is between $\\theta$ and $\\beta$ which is introduced by the edges between $\\theta, \\mathbf{z}$ and $\\mathbf{w}$ (remember w is a 'collision' node and is observed). If we simplify our model by removing these edges along with the <b>w</b> node, and introduce two variational parameters $\\gamma$ and $\\phi$ which give a family of distributions over the remaining latent variables, we are left with the graphical model shown on the right in the figure below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![LDA VI](imgs/LDAVIGM.png \"GM for the VI used for our LDA\")\n",
    "\n",
    "This results in the following distribution over the latent variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "p( \\theta, \\mathbf{z} \\mid \\gamma, \\phi) = q(\\theta\\mid\\gamma)\\prod_{n=1}^Nq(z_n\\mid\\phi_n)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where the new Dirichlet parameters $\\gamma$ and the multinomial parameters $\\phi$ are the free variational parameters. Now having simplified our graphical model, we need to find the optimal values for the variational parameters ($\\gamma^*, \\phi^*$). From Olga's tutorial we know that this is equivalent to finding the values which minimize the KL divergence between the simplified distribution and the true posterior distribution:\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "We do this by setting the derivatives of the KL divergence to zero w.r.t $\\gamma$ and $\\phi$ we get the following update equations for the parameters:\n",

It is important to note that these update equations derived from the KL divergence are dependant on a certain choice of <b>w</b>.

The log likelihood of the data given $\\beta$ and $\\alpha$ is intractable as we saw at the end of the previous section. However, it is possible to implement a variational EM procedure that gives us an approximation of the best value for $\\beta$ by first maximizing a lower bound for the optimal variational parameters $\\gamma^*,\\phi^*$, then maximizing the lower bound w.r.t $\\beta$ with the previously acquired variational parameters. Essentially we will iterate the following steps until a sufficient level of convergence:\n",

Now, use the pseudo code to fill in the missing code in the \"MaxVIParam\" function defined earlier and remember to use the provided diGamma function. To see that your implementation seems to be working, set nIter to 1 and add some printouts of the difference between updates for gamma, then check that they are converging to something smaller."

If you take a look at the pseudo code we used for the MaxVIParam method, you can see that the posterior gamma parameter $\\gamma_i $we are calculating is approximately the prior Dichlet parameter $\\alpha_i$ added to the expected number of words that were generated by that $i^{th}$ topic for a certain document. Looking at the values for the different $\\gamma_i$ over all words for a test document tells us what mixture of topics form such a document. Let us now take a look at the mixtures for some of our test documents by running the code in the cell below: "

    "Well done! You have now implemented LDA, approximated the necessary variational parameters, and examined the results to infer information about topics in documents. If you feel like you would like to experiment some more, there are some variants that you could try:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load the provided dataset from the Associated Press docs dataset. This has random news articles from an undisclosed number of topics. Replace the dataset code in the beginning with what is provided in the next cell and redo your tests. What kind of topics does your result have? How many topics did you assume there were? (Some interesting cases I got were general topics like Crime and Economics and then one focusing solely on foreign affairs with President Bush)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Run the tests using the MoodyLyrics dataset instead. This dataset includes the lyrics from songs in many different genres (I've included has slightly less than 200 / 50 documents and V=500). Run the tests again and see what kind of sense LDA tries to make out of these song lyrics. The dataset also provides an annotation as to what emotion (\"Angry\", \"Sad\", \"Happy\", \"Relaxed\") the song exhibits. Can you find a resemblence in your topics to these emotions? (<i>Disclaimer: The lyrics provided are not censored and some are not exactly \"PG-13\")</i>\n",
